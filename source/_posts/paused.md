title: Why I decided to stop writing
---

Hey everybody,

That sounds terrible to me? Actually, I don't think so. Of course, I know writing is very important to expressing thoughts and life, especially for newbie writers have an occasional day off.

In the past two years, I posted off and on [dozens of articles](/2015). Since October 8, 2015, the day after National Day—I've stopped writing the blog. There are so many reasons to explain why I do it. However, these are too subjective to talk.

In a few words, I am just not enjoy writing anymore, even when I created a minimalist theme `dandelion` with elegant typography. There are philosophical questions below I’ve asked myself for months:

- Why did I write it down? For sharing stories or relieving pressure?
- What’s my writing worth?
- How much do I know about myself?

Well, now I got an answer that keeping the writing paused for a long period of time in public platforms. I will spend more time in composing fantastic flows.

> Keep silent and compose flows for a better new beginning.

Kindly,
